1. I think my degree of success was 98% or even 100% for this 
assignment. I think when I type a number with multiple zeros like
50000.445, it usually rounds and gives the number such as 5e+07. I 
think it is fine that it rounds, but for accuracy, maybe I could've
done more like print out the entire number. Otherwise, I think my 
formatting and statements all seemed correct.

2. When approaching this project, I had to first understand what 
a union was, and how it was broken up into 3 parts: the mantissa,
exponent, and sign bits. I then had to understand that each bit was
broken up to store up to 1 bit. Then I realized a string of
bit_string was created with 43 indexes was used for printing out
the bits. Towards the bottom, each bit from the union was copied
over into the bit_string array, where it checked each bit of the 
union's bit structure if that bit was true (1) or false(0)
using a ternary operator. Based on that, would place respective
1's and 0's into the coresponding index in the bit_string array.
I then started printing out each bit parts, where I would have to
print the statement first, and then write a for loop for the mantissa
and exponentto print the bits from a certain range versus printing it
all out together. I had to figure out which format specifier to use to
print out these different types of numbers. I also had to figure out
justification and spacing to make each line align with each other.   

3. I was able to figure out my problems for this project. Nothing
was left unresolved.
