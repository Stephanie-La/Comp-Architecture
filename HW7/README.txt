1. I think my degree of success is 97-100%.

2. First off, professor Moloney gave us a help file that
we had to fill in. He gave us a partial help file program
where it creates lcoal variables to create a pipe that will
be a parent pipe. After collecting the parent's information,
we need to create a child pipe which inherits information 
from the parent pipe and the parent will terminate. The child
pipe would now report its process and thread information from 
the parents information. The child process would then read
the parent's tring from the pipe and output it onto the 
screen. the child will reprint the parent's process ID one 
more time and then terminate as well. Fist off, there were
many comments among the program to help guide us and fill in 
the appropriate lines to terminate, copy, read, and write 
parent pipe information and strings. It was straightforward 
since I copied the parent pipe information formats and pasted
them for the inherited child formats. Exit functions were easy
and self explanatory. Even though Professor Moloney also walked 
us through his own program to show us what to write and how to
write the lines, I left comments so I could understand the 
process and handling of information.

3. It is noted that professor Moloney's program also does the 
same thing. When you run the program, the program doesn't 
terminate on it's own, so you have to press the enter 
key or control + c to stop the program.
